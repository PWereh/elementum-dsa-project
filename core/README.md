# Elementum DSA Core Components

This directory contains the core framework components for the Elementum Domain-Specific Agent (DSA) Governance Framework.

## Components

- `agent.py` - Base agent class and interfaces
- `knowledge.py` - Knowledge base structures and interfaces
- `protocols.py` - Communication and interaction protocols
- `governance.py` - Governance and compliance mechanisms
- `monitoring.py` - Performance monitoring and metrics

## Architecture

The core architecture follows a modular design with standardized interfaces to ensure compatibility across all components. Each agent implementation must inherit from the base Agent class and implement the required interfaces.

## Integration

All core components are designed to be extended and specialized for specific domain implementations. See the [Core Integration Guide](../docs/core-integration.md) for detailed instructions.
